1. Application Setup and Configuration
 Set the security level appropriately for testing; if using in a more exposed setup, ensure higher security settings are enforced.
 Configure the database connection securely: Use strong credentials and ensure that the database does not have more privileges than necessary.
 Keep DVWA and its components up to date to protect against vulnerabilities found in older versions.
2. Authentication and Session Management
 Implement strong password policies: Ensure complexity requirements and minimum length to defend against brute force attacks.
 Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) to add an additional layer of security.
 Secure cookie settings: Use HttpOnly and Secure flags to protect cookies from being accessed by client-side scripts and transmitted over unsecured connections.
 Session timeout: Implement automatic session expiration to reduce the risk of session hijacking.
 Limit login attempts to prevent automated attacks and brute force attempts.
3. Input Validation and Data Sanitization
 Validate all inputs on both client-side and server-side to prevent common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS, and command injection.
 Sanitize data used in SQL queries, command-line calls, LDAP queries, and other interpreters to prevent injection attacks.
 Use parameterized queries for database access to avoid SQL injection.
4. Error Handling and Logging
 Implement proper error handling that does not disclose sensitive information about the application, database, or underlying system.
 Log security-relevant events such as login successes and failures, high-value transactions, and system errors.
 Protect log files: Ensure that log files are stored securely and not accessible via the web server.
5. Network and Communication Security
 Enforce HTTPS to secure data in transit. Use TLS with strong ciphers for encryption.
 Configure security headers: Implement headers such as Content-Security-Policy, X-Frame-Options, and X-Content-Type-Options to enhance security.
6. File Handling and Uploads
 Restrict file uploads: If file uploads are necessary, restrict the file types, scan for malware, and store files outside of the webroot.
 Ensure secure file permissions: Files and directories should have the correct permissions to prevent unauthorized access.
7. Database Security
 Secure database configuration: Minimize the databaseâ€™s exposure to the internet, use firewalls, and segment the database from other networks.
 Regularly back up the database and ensure that backups are secure and tested for integrity.
8. Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing
 Conduct regular security audits and reviews to check compliance with security policies and practices.
 Perform penetration testing: Use tools and techniques to test the defenses of the application regularly.
9. Patch Management
 Stay informed about new vulnerabilities and apply patches and updates promptly.
10. Education and Awareness
 Train developers and users on security awareness, particularly regarding common web vulnerabilities and secure coding practices.
This checklist provides a framework for securing DVWA or any similar web application. It's important to adapt and expand this checklist based on specific organizational needs, the particular deployment environment, and emerging security threats.
